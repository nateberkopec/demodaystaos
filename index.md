## Taos DemoDays

Taos DemoDays is a regular gathering where Taos’ tech community shares what they’ve been up to with small, informal demos and lightning talks.

Open to all technologists, programmers, makers, digital doers and tech hobbyists of all sizes and stripes. 

### The Format

DemoDays go like this:

1. Everyone is encouraged to "demo", for 2 minutes, a tech or tech-adjacent thing that they've worked on or played with recently.
2. 0 to `n` people who want to do longer demos of up to 10 minutes give their demos.
3. Finish up with food, drinks and informal chatter.

### The Next Event

The next DemoDay event is on **Wednesday, September 8th 2021** from 5:30-7pm at Taos HIVE, 1146 Gusdorf Road.

### How To Demo

We encourage _every_ attendee of a DemoDay to present. It's really easy!

You can present in a 2 minute (short demo) or 10 minute (long demo) slot. You don't have to be polished or even, really, prepared.

The only requriement to speak at a DemoDay is that you must present a tech or tech-adjacent "thing" that you, personally, have worked on recently. It doesn't have to be finished, it doesn't have to be perfect, and if it's a 2-minute short demo, honestly, don't even worry if it's all that interesting. The purpose of demos is to introduce yourself to the room, share what you're about, and hopefully introduce people to a cool new technology or thing you've made.

Here are some example things you could demo:

1. An open-source project you created or worked on recently.
2. A home-automation gadget you made recently that feeds your cat every time it meows loudly.
3. A new audio plugin you made for Ableton.
4. A digital art project.
5. A fun technogadget you've been messing around with lately, like Sonic Pi.

Email us at [admin@taosdemodays.com](mailto:admin@taosdemodays.com) with your name, desired time length (2 or 10 minutes) and your presentation materials in either PowerPoint, Keynote, PDF, or image (JPG, PNG etc) format. We encourage you to email us all of your presentation materials so we can pre-load them on a single laptop. It helps keep things moving.
